Name
    Math::Permute::List - Generate all permutations of a list.

Synopsis
     use Math::Permute::List;

     permute {say "@_"} qw(a b c);

     #  a b c

Description
    Generate and process all the all the permutations of a list using the

    "permute()" returns the number of permutations in both scalar and array
    context.

    Its easy to use and fast. Its written in 100% Pure Perl.

    Please note that the order in which the permutations are generated is
    not guaranteed, so please do not rely on it.

Export
    The "permute()" function is exported.

Installation
    Standard Module::Build process for building and installing modules:

      perl Build.PL
      ./Build
      ./Build test
      ./Build install

    Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't require
    the "./" notation, you can do this:

      perl Build.PL
      Build
